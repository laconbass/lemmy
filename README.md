# LEMMY: 49% Motherfucker | 51% Son of a Bitch JS/CS Express+Mocha Boilerplate

No better yet humble hommage to the Godfather of Heavy Metal, [Lemmy Kilmister][0]. 
Perhaps you may have heard of him as the trust-worthy roadie of [Jimi
Hendrix][1], the raw base of the 70's space rock powerhouse [Hawkwind][2] or, most 
probably, as the relentless force behind the all-mighty [Mot√∂rhead][3].

As the remarkable individual, living legend and true rock-star; this
tool aims at emulating all the characteristics that make of Lemmy a
one-of-a-kind person: simple, straight-forward, generous, smart, and practical.

Designed from scratch to kick-start your [Express][4] application in 
either Javascript or [Coffee-Script][5] in no time and agilize the 
management of the most common tasks during the development, testing, and
deployment of your project by just using Makefile and a couple of Bash commands
available on your OSX system.
