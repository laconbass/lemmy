# LEMMY. 
## 49% Motherfucker | 51% Son of a Bitch JS/CS Express+Mocha+HTML5 boilerplate that kicks your ass.

No better yet humble hommage to the Godfather of Heavy Metal, __[Lemmy Kilmister][0]__. 
Perhaps you may have heard of him as the trust-worthy roadie of *[Jimi
Hendrix][1]*, the raw base of the 70's space rock powerhouse *[Hawkwind][2]* or, most 
probably, as the relentless force behind the all-mighty *[Mot√∂rhead][3]*.

As the remarkable individual, living legend and true rock-star; this
tool aims at emulating all the characteristics that make of __Lemmy__ a
one-of-a-kind person: *simple*, *straight-forward*, *pragmatic*, and *practical*.

### Purpose

Designed from scratch to kick-start your *[Express][4]* application in 
either *Javascript* or *[Coffee-Script][5]* in no time and agilize the 
management of the most common tasks during the development, testing, and
deployment of your project by just using Makefile and a couple of Bash commands
available on your Linux/OSX system.

### Pre-Requisites

You're required to use a BSD-like system that support Makefiles, uses
[Bash shell][6], have [Git source code management system][7] and [Node.js][8] installed
