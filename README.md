## LEMMY: 49% Motherfucker | 51% Son of a Bitch JS/CS Express+Mocha project Boilerplate

No better yet humble hommage to the Godfather of Heavy Metal, __[Lemmy Kilmister][0]__. 
Perhaps you may have heard of him as the trust-worthy roadie of *[Jimi
Hendrix][1]*, the raw base of the 70's space rock powerhouse *[Hawkwind][2]* or, most 
probably, as the relentless force behind the all-mighty *[Mot√∂rhead][3]*.

As the remarkable individual, living legend and true rock-star; this
tool aims at emulating all the characteristics that make of __Lemmy__ a
one-of-a-kind person: *simple*, *straight-forward*, *generous*, *smart*, and *practical*.

Designed from scratch to kick-start your *[Express][4]* application in 
either *Javascript* or *[Coffee-Script][5]* in no time and agilize the 
management of the most common tasks during the development, testing, and
deployment of your project by just using Makefile and a couple of Bash commands
available on your OSX system.

### Pre-Requisites

You're required to use a BSD-like system that support Makefiles, uses
[Bash shell][6], have [Git source code management system][7] and [Node.JS][8] installed 
on your machine. That's all you need!

### How to Use

It is very easy to use __Lemmy__. In fact, all you need to do is the
following:

```shell

* Modify the *package.json* file to your requirements with your Text
  Editor of choice.
