# LEMMY. 
## 49% Motherfucker | 51% Son of a Bitch JS/CS Express+Mocha+HTML5 boilerplate that kicks your ass.

A humble homage to __The Man__ himself, the Godfather of Heavy Metal: __[Lemmy Kilmister][0]__.
 
Perhaps you may have heard of him as the trust-worthy roadie of *[Jimi Hendrix][1]*, 
the raw base of the 70's space rock powerhouse *[Hawkwind][2]* or, most 
probably, as the relentless force behind the all-mighty *[Mot√∂rhead][3]*.

### Purpose

The idea is simple: __Express.js development on speed!__

Designed from scratch to kick-start your *[Express][4]* application in 
either *Javascript* or *[Coffee-Script][5]* in no time and agilize the 
management of the most common tasks during the development, testing, and
deployment of your project by just using Makefile and a couple of Bash commands
available on your Linux/OSX system without imposing any convention or creating 
any web framework.

### Pre-Requisites

You're required to use a BSD-like system that support Makefiles, uses
[Bash shell][6], have [Git source code management system][7] and [Node.js][8] installed 
on your machine. That's all you need!

### Quick Start

It is very easy to start using __Lemmy__. In fact, all you need to do is:

* Fork this project and rename it as you like.

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/rock-n-code/lemmy your_project_name
```

* Setup your project and choose your language of choice

```shell
  cd your_project_name && make setup [LANGUAGE=cs]
```

* Modify the *package.json* file to your requirements with your Text
  Editor of choice.

* Install all the dependencies locally.

```shell
  make dependencies
```
